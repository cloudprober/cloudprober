# Cloudprober probe configuration using Consul for target discovery
#
# This example demonstrates how to use Consul to discover targets for probing.

# Probe HTTP services discovered from Consul
probe {
  name: "consul_http_services"
  type: HTTP

  targets {
    consul {
      address: "localhost:8500"

      # Discover all services matching the pattern
      services: "web-.*"

      # Filter by tags (all must match)
      tags: "http"
      tags: "production"

      # Only target healthy services
      health_status: "passing"

      # Refresh targets every 30 seconds
      re_eval_sec: 30
    }
  }

  http_probe {
    relative_url: "/health"
  }

  interval_msec: 10000  # 10 seconds
  timeout_msec: 5000    # 5 seconds
}

# Alternative: Probe a specific Consul service by name
probe {
  name: "api_service"
  type: HTTP

  targets {
    consul {
      address: "localhost:8500"
      services: "api"  # Exact service name
      health_status: "passing"
    }
  }

  http_probe {
    relative_url: "/api/health"
  }

  interval_msec: 30000
}
