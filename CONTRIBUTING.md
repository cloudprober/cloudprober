# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your contributions to this project. There are just a few
small guidelines you need to follow.

* All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
  use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub
  Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
  information on using pull requests.

* Before you start working on a non-trivial change, please let us know through
  [Issues](https://github.com/cloudprober/cloudprober/issues) or
  [Discussions](https://github.com/cloudprober/cloudprober/discussions).

* Please avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely required by the functionality.

* We try to limit comment lines to 80 chars. Having comment lines that are arbitrarily
  long makes them uncomfortable to the eyes.
