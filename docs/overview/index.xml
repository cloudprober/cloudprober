Employing an &amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo; monitoring approach, Cloudprober executes probes on or against these systems to verify their proper functioning.
For example, you could use Cloudprober to run a probe to verify that your users can access your website and your APIs, your microservices can talk to each other, your kubernetes clusters can schedule pods, your CI/CD pipelines are functioning as expected, or VPN connectivity with your partners is working as expected, and much more.</description></item><item><title>What is a Probe</title><link>https://cloudprober.org/docs/overview/probe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloudprober.org/docs/overview/probe/</guid><description>Cloudprober&amp;rsquo;s main task is to run probes. A probe executes something, usually against a set of targets, to verify that the systems are working as expected from consumers&amp;rsquo; point of view. For example, an HTTP probe executes an HTTP request against a web server to verify that the web server is available. Cloudprober probes run repeatedly at a configured interval and export probe results as a set of metrics.
A probe is defined as a set of the following fields:</description></item></channel></rss>
