cloudprober --version Your First Run #
Run cloudprober with no arguments:
cloudprober On Linux, cloudprober automatically adds a sys_metrics system probe that exports memory, CPU load, uptime, disk, and network metrics &amp;ndash; no config needed.</description></item><item><title>Overview</title><link>https://cloudprober.org/docs/overview/cloudprober/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloudprober.org/docs/overview/cloudprober/</guid><description>Cloudprober supercharges your monitoring with active probes (a.k.a. synthetic monitoring) to ensure your systems—homelabs, microservices, APIs, websites, or cloud-to-on-prem connections—run as expected. See this post for why probers provide one of the most reliable monitoring signals.
Why Cloudprober? #
Versatile Probes: Built-in HTTP, PING, TCP, DNS, gRPC, and UDP probes, plus custom checks via external probes.
Auto-Discover Targets: Effortlessly monitor Kubernetes, GCP, or file-based resources without constant redeployment.
Integrate with Existing Systems: Out-of-the-box integration with Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog, AWS CloudWatch, PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud Monitoring.</description></item><item><title>What is a Probe</title><link>https://cloudprober.org/docs/overview/probe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloudprober.org/docs/overview/probe/</guid><description>Active Monitoring with Probes #
Most monitoring is passive &amp;ndash; you collect logs, scrape application metrics, or wait for errors to show up in dashboards. This tells you what&amp;rsquo;s happening inside your systems, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you what your users are actually experiencing. A service can report healthy metrics internally while being unreachable from the outside due to a DNS misconfiguration, a firewall rule, or an expired certificate.
Probes take the opposite approach.</description></item></channel></rss>
