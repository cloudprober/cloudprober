Cloudprober employs the &amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo; monitoring model. It runs probes against (or on) your components to verify that they are working as expected. For example, it can run a probe to verify that your frontends can reach your backends. Similarly it can run a probe to verify that your in-Cloud VMs can actually reach your on-premise systems.</description></item><item><title>What is a Probe</title><link>http://cloudprober.org/docs/overview/probe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cloudprober.org/docs/overview/probe/</guid><description>Cloudprober&amp;rsquo;s main task is to run probes. A probe executes something, usually against a set of targets, to verify that the systems are working as expected from consumers&amp;rsquo; point of view. For example, an HTTP probe executes an HTTP request against a web server to verify that the web server is available. Cloudprober probes run repeatedly at a configured interval and export probe results as a set of metrics.
A probe is defined as a set of the following fields:</description></item></channel></rss>
