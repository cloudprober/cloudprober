Cloudprober can natively export metrics to AWS Cloudwatch using the cloudwatch
[surfacer](/surfacers/overview). Adding the cloudwatch surfacer to cloudprover
is as simple as adding the following stanza to the config:

```
surfacer {
  type: CLOUDWATCH
}
```

## Authentication

The cloudwatch surfacer uses the AWS Go SDK, and supports the
[default credential chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v2/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html):

1. Environment variables.
2. Shared credentials file.
3. If your application uses an ECS task definition or RunTask API operation, IAM
   role for tasks.
4. If your application is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, IAM role for Amazon
   EC2.

### Cloudwatch Region

The list below is the order of precedence that will be used to determine the
[AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html)
that Cloudprober will publish metrics to.

1. [Region configuration](#configuration-options)
2. EC2 metadata.
3. `AWS_REGION` environment variable.
4. `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable, if `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` is set
   (See
   [AWS package documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/)
   for more details).

## Authorization

In order to permit Cloudprober to publish metric data to cloudwatch, ensure the
profile being used for authentication has the following permissions, where the
"cloudwatch:namespace" is the [metric namespace](#metric-namespace) used by
Cloudprober.

If the default metric namespace is changed, also change the condition in the IAM
policy below to match the same value.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Condition": {
                "StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
                    "cloudwatch:namespace": "cloudprober"
                }
            },
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "PutMetrics"
        }
    ]
}
```

## [Metric Namespace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Namespace)

The metric namespace used to publish metrics to by default is set to
`cloudprober`. This can be changed by expanding the surfacer configuration:

```
surfacer {
  type: CLOUDWATCH

  cloudwatch_surfacer {
    namespace: "/cloudprober/website/probes"
  }
}
```

Note: If the namespace is modified, also modify the
[IAM policy condition](#authorization) for the namespace PutMetricData call.

## Configuration Options

The full list of configuration options for the cloudwatch surfacer is:

```protobuf
  // The cloudwatch metric namespace
  optional string namespace = 1 [default = "cloudprober"];

  // The cloudwatch resolution value, lowering this below 60 will incur
  // additional charges as the metrics will be charged at a high resolution rate.
  optional int64 resolution = 2 [default=60];

  // The AWS Region, used to create a CloudWatch session.
  // The order of fallback for evaluating the AWS Region:
  // 1. This config value.
  // 2. EC2 metadata endpoint, via cloudprober sysvars.
  // 3. AWS_REGION environment value.
  // 4. AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment value, if AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG is set.
  // https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/
  optional string region = 3;

  // The maximum number of metrics that will be published at one
  // time. Metrics will be stored locally in a cache until this
  // limit is reached. 1000 is the maximum number of metrics
  // supported by the Cloudwatch PutMetricData API.
  // Metrics will be published when the timer expires, or the buffer is
  // full, whichever happens first.
  optional int32 metrics_batch_size = 4 [default = 1000];

  // The maximum amount of time to hold metrics in the buffer (above).
  // Metrics will be published when the timer expires, or the buffer is
  // full, whichever happens first.
  optional int32 batch_timer_sec = 5 [default = 30];
```

## Calculating the metric delta with Cloudwatch Metric Maths

The metrics produced by Cloudprober are cumulative. Most services producing
metrics into cloudwatch produce snapshot data whereby the metrics are recorded
for a specific point in time.

In order to achieve a similar effect here, the
[Cloudwatch Metric Maths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html)
RATE and PERIOD functions can be used to determine the delta values.

```
RATE(m1) * PERIOD(m1)
```

Whereby m1 is the metric id for the Cloudprober metrics, for example:

```
namespace: cloudprober
metric name: latency
dst: google.com
ptype: http
probe: probe name
```
