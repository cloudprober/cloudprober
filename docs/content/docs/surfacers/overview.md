One of the biggest strengths of cloudprober is that it can export data to
multiple monitoring systems, even simultaneously, just based on simple
configuration. Cloudprober does that using a built-in mechanism, called
surfacers. Each surfacer type implements interface for a specific monitoring
system, for example,
[_cloudwatch_](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_cloudwatch_SurfacerConf)
surfacer publishes data to AWS Cloudwatch. You can configure multiple surfacers
at the same time. If you don't specify any surfacer,
[_prometheus_](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_prometheus_SurfacerConf)
and
[_file_](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_file_SurfacerConf)
surfacers are enabled automatically.

Cloudprober currently supports following surfacer types:

- Prometheus
  ([config](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_prometheus_SurfacerConf))
- OpenTelemetry (OTEL)
  ([config](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_otel_SurfacerConf))
  [New in v0.13.2]
- [Stackdriver (Google Cloud Monitoring)](../stackdriver)
- Google Pub/Sub
  ([config](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_pubsub_SurfacerConf))
- Postgres
  ([config](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_postgres_SurfacerConf))
- File
  ([config](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_file_SurfacerConf))
- [Cloudwatch (AWS Cloud Monitoring)](../cloudwatch)

Overall
[surfacers config](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_SurfacerDef).

It's easy to add more surfacers without having to understand the internals of
cloudprober. You only need to implement the
[Surfacer interface](https://github.com/cloudprober/cloudprober/blob/7bc30b62e42f3fe4e8a2fb8cd0e87ea18b73aeb8/surfacers/surfacers.go#L87).

## Configuration

Adding surfacers to cloudprober is as easy as adding "surfacer" config stanzas
to your config, like the following:

```shell
# Enable prometheus and stackdriver surfacers.

# Make probe metrics available at the URL :<cloudprober_port>/metrics, for
# scraping by prometheus.
surfacer {
  type: PROMETHEUS

  prometheus_surfacer {
    # Following option adds a prefix to exported metrics, for example,
    # "total" metric is exported as "cloudprober_total".
    metrics_prefix: "cloudprober_"
  }
}

# Stackdriver (Google Cloud Monitoring) surfacer_ No other configuration
# is necessary if running on GCP.
surfacer {
  type: STACKDRIVER
}
```

## Filtering Metrics

You can control which metrics are published to a surfacer using the filtering
mechanisms. For example, you may want to publish only specific metrics to AWS
Cloudwatch to save on the costs.

### Filtering by Label

To filter metrics by labels, use one of the following options in the
[surfacers config](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_SurfacerDef):

- `allow_metrics_with_label` (`allowMetricsWithLabel` in yaml)
- `ignore_metrics_with_label` (`ignoreMetricsWithLabel` in yaml)

_Note: `ignore_metrics_with_label` takes precedence over
`allow_metrics_with_label`._

For example, to ignore all `sysvar` metrics:

```
surfacer {
  type: PROMETHEUS

  ignore_metrics_with_label {
    key: "probe",
    value: "sysvars",
  }
}
```

Or to only allow metrics from http probes:

```
surfacer {
  type: PROMETHEUS

  allow_metrics_with_label {
    key: "ptype",
    value: "http",
  }
}
```

#### Filtering by Metric Name

To filter metrics by name, use one of the following options in the
[surfacers config](https://cloudprober.org/docs/config/surfacer/#cloudprober_surfacer_SurfacerDef):

- `allow_metrics_with_name ` (`allowMetricsWithName` in yaml)
- `ignore_metrics_with_name` (`ignoreMetricsWithName` in yaml)

_Note: `ignore_metrics_with_name` takes precedence over
`allow_metrics_with_name`._

To filter out all `validation_failure` metrics by name:

```
surfacer {
  type: PROMETHEUS

  ignore_metrics_with_name: "validation_failure"
}
```

## Modifying Metrics

You can configure surfacers to modify the metrics before they are sent to the
backend monitoring system:

1. **add_failure_metric**: Export failure count along with the default _total_
   and _success_ metrics:

   ```
   surfacer {
      type: ...

      add_failure_metric = true
      ..
   }
   ```

   _NOTE: This option is now enabled by default for all surfacers, except for
   FILE and PUBSUB surfacers._

2. **export_as_gauge**: Export gauge metrics instead of cumulative. Cloudprober
   exports cumulative metrics (sum of values so far) by default, but you can
   configure it to export gauge metrics instead. Gauge metrics make
   point-in-time calculations easier (e.g. you can just divide latency by
   success to get the average latency), but we lose the historical information
   if metrics are not received for a few intervals for some reason.

   ```
   surfacer {
      type: ...

      export_as_gauge = true
      ..
   }
   ```
