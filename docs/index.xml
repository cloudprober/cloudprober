I started building Cloudprober in 2016, while I was at Google, leading the Cloud Networking SRE team there. Google Cloud was just beginning to grow big, and we were still grappling with some early growth issue. Our biggest problem was that our customers were discovering problems before us, which resulted in bad experience for our customers and huge time sink for my team in debugging those issues.</description></item><item><title>Cloudwatch (AWS)</title><link>https://cloudprober.org/docs/surfacers/cloudwatch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloudprober.org/docs/surfacers/cloudwatch/</guid><description>Cloudprober can natively export metrics to AWS Cloudwatch using the cloudwatch surfacer. Adding the cloudwatch surfacer to cloudprover is as simple as adding the following stanza to the config:
surfacer { type: CLOUDWATCH } Authentication #
The cloudwatch surfacer uses the AWS Go SDK, and supports the default credential chain:
Environment variables. Shared credentials file. If your application uses an ECS task definition or RunTask API operation, IAM role for tasks.</description></item><item><title>Exporting Metrics (Surfacers)</title><link>https://cloudprober.org/docs/surfacers/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloudprober.org/docs/surfacers/overview/</guid><description>One of the biggest strengths of cloudprober is that it can export data to multiple monitoring systems, even simultaneously, just based on simple configuration. Cloudprober does that using a built-in mechanism, called surfacers. Each surfacer type implements interface for a specific monitoring system, for example, cloudwatch surfacer publishes data to AWS Cloudwatch. You can configure multiple surfacers at the same time. If you don&amp;rsquo;t specify any surfacer, prometheus and file surfacers are enabled automatically.</description></item><item><title>Stackdriver (Google Cloud)</title><link>https://cloudprober.org/docs/surfacers/stackdriver/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloudprober.org/docs/surfacers/stackdriver/</guid><description>Cloudprober can natively export metrics to Google Cloud Monitoring (formerly, Stackdriver) using stackdriver surfacer. Adding stackdriver surfacer to cloudprober is as simple as adding the following stanza to the config:
surfacer { type: STACKDRIVER } This config will work if you&amp;rsquo;re running on GCP and your VM (or GKE pod) has access to Cloud Monitoring (Stackdriver). If running on any other platform, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to specify the GCP project where you want to send the metrics, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have to configure your environment for Google Application Default Credentials.</description></item></channel></rss>
