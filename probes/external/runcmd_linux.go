// This file defines Linux specific implementaion of runCommand. We don't use
// the standard exec.CommandOutput method as it doesn't provide a way to clean
// up the further processes started by the command. We start the given command
// in a new process group, and kill the whole process group on time out.
// Background: https://github.com/cloudprober/cloudprober/issues/165.
